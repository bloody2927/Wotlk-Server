# AzerothCore - Personal Fork by Bloody2927

This is my personal fork of [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk), created and maintained as part of my **education as an IT specialist for system integration (Fachinformatiker für Systemintegration)**.

## Purpose

I use this project to:

- improve my understanding of **C++ programming** and AzerothCore's modular structure,
- learn how a **complex game server system** works (core, database, scripts, configuration),
- experiment with **custom modules, NPCs, quests, and items**,
- gain practical experience with **Git, Visual Studio, CMake, SQL, OpenSSL, and other tools**,
- build a development foundation for future server-side programming and systems administration.

> This project is for **learning, testing, and development purposes only**.
